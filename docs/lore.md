# LORE/VIBES

### Intro outline

A town and its people have survived in the depths of a dungeon for generations.
Nobody is fully sure how the town got there or why, but the town elders assure
everyone that "those who came before us founded this town down here for good
reasons even if we may not know why anymore." 

The town functions by scavenging the lower levels of the dungeon. Although the
town's people know that the town exists within the dungeon, no stair leading
upwards had ever been found. Rumors speak of a secret passage way that lead to
the upper floor, but nobody has ever found such a passage.


### Initial Gameplay 

MC is told to go to the hall of elders:
- MC is given the job of scavanger
- Elders give player first weapons
- Big celebration
- MC meets key characters

The MC is sent on their first expedition to scavange. General game mechanics are
displayed through the initial dungeon level. MC comes across a hidden room with
a hard boss and is trapped. MC is killed

### Hero's Story Trope - supernatrual help

*(This also teaches general game death mechanic)*

MC is offered help by a voice in their head (we'll refer to voice in head as character V for now): 
- I can revive you, but you must take me where ever you go and you must listen to what I tell you.

MC is revived and must make their way back up to town.

MC makes their way back to town. Town is on fire, MS is given
quest to go to the hall of elders from V in head. 

- Elders are dead
- boss fight
  - boss looks different from other bosses. *Angelic, mechanical, digital?*
- something important is taken from MC (idk, girl, pet, town's sacred texts)

Boss fight ends with the help of V, one elder is still kind of alive, tasks
player to go after enemy and retrieve important thing that was taken.

Last elder gives key to location Y in town which has stairs to go up into dungeon and dies. 

### Going up

V gives mainline quests to drive story. Side characters give side quests along
the way. General game mechanics from here.

As the game progresses, the player gains hints about the surface. 

### Reaching the surface, end game, and game loop

The game up until this point has been primarily fantacy except for possibly finding
rare tech artifacts. The surface is futuristic and utopian and humanity is thriving.

They have no concept of magic.

V tasks us with going to *some_important_location* to retrieve *important thing*.

- MC arrives and retrieves *important thing*
- V betrays MC and tries to take over the surface.
- MC must sacrifice self or *important thing* to beat V and save surface. (Player should be given an actual choice, this could be really funny)
- People on surface are saved by being teleported back down into the dungeon where the town was.
